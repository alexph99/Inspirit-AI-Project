# Inspirit-AI-Project

This is a project I helped developed for Inspirit AI. Where we used AI to enhance sustainable farming by predicting crop yield from soil's bacterial composition. We explored different AI applications for sustainability, learning how natural bacterial boost plant growth and reforestation. Additionally, I've created discussions where I can discuss the role of AI in policy-making for sustainable agriculture and conservation. This project empowers you with AI tools to help combat climate change and improve farming practices.
 
* Aim: Promote sustainable farming or reforestation by predicting crop yield based on the bacterial composition of soil
* Methodology: Use models such as decision trees to ensure high interpretability, especially for potential government decision-making regarding farm development
* Objective: 
    * Identify areas with high plant growth potential to facilitate more efficient and sustainable farming or reforestation initiatives
    * Explore advanced machine learning topics to enhance the modelâ€™s performance and capabilities
